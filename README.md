# Wireless-Receiver-Unit
The Wireless Receiver Unit is to be used in conjunction with the GPS Fan Controller.  This unit is based on the ESP8266 D1 MINI Pro microcontroller from Wemos (Ali Express).
The code was developed in the Visual Studio Code IDE, with the PlatformIO plugin.
The Wemos D1 Mini Pro is designed for use with a 3.7V battery.  
The microcontroller is used to receive data via the 433MHz receiver module, using the RadioHead RH_ASK.h module library. 
The microcontroller is also used to drive the OLED display (SSD1306) using the Adafruit SSD1306.h library.  
The unit is powered by a rechargeable 3.7V 18650 Lithium battery.
